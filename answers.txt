1. Report the estimated ground truth car bounding box (choose only one per image; closest to detection; xywh format) and IoU with the closest detection for each car image provided in this assignment. Total of three ground truth bounding boxes, and three IoUs.

cars1
ground truth: xcenter = 165.5, ycenter = 135, width = 101, height = 66
IoU = 0.0001435

cars2
ground truth: xcenter = 110, ycenter = 119.5, width = 150, height = 121
IoU = 0.000049871

cars3
ground truth: xcenter = 131, ycenter = 99, width = 56, height = 140
IoU = 0.0003675

2. Report the MeanAP on the validation dataset.

3. Do you notice any discrepencies in performance over different classes? Hint: check the Average Precision per class.
